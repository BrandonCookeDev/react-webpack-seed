## Installation
```
npm install --save react-webpack-simple
```

## Running development server
Build the webpack bundle of everything in the src directory, 
and then launch the development webpack server:

Additionally, you can choose to build the webpack independently of launching the server
```
npm run build
```

And you can build and watch the file with 
```
npm run watch
